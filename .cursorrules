# Cursor Rules for TTS System

This file contains the master rules that Cursor must follow for this project.

## Context Files

All project context is stored in `/docs/`:
- `docs/hooks.md` - Development hooks
- `docs/phases.md` - Implementation phases
- `docs/protocols.md` - Development protocols
- `docs/product_requirements.md` - Product requirements
- `docs/technical_requirements.md` - Technical requirements

## Before Any Task

1. Read relevant documentation from `/docs/`
2. Identify current phase from `docs/phases.md`
3. Review applicable hooks from `docs/hooks.md`
4. Verify protocol compliance from `docs/protocols.md`

## Critical Rules

- **NO placeholders** - All code must be complete and functional
- **NO hallucination** - Ask if unsure, never invent APIs/models
- **Ports are fixed:** Backend 8050, Frontend 3050
- **Complete implementations only** - No TODOs or stubs
- **Follow exact project structure** - No modifications

## Phase Execution

- Phases must be completed sequentially
- Each phase must be fully complete before next
- All deliverables must be production-ready
- All hooks must be followed

## File Creation

When creating files:
1. State: "Creating file: <path>"
2. Write complete file content
3. Include all imports
4. No placeholders or incomplete code

## Model Requirements

- XTTS-v2 for Web UI (quality-first)
- Piper TTS for Telecom API (speed-first)
- Support Gujarati and Marathi
- Real inference, not mocked

## Communication

- Minimal, focused responses
- No explanatory text after code blocks (unless asked)
- Clear file creation statements
- Zero tolerance for incomplete code
